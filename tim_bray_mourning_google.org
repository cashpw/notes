#+begin_quote
Psychopaths Â· For my money, that was the center of Google's problem. Larry and Sergey were smart guys who recognized they didn't know shit about corporateness and quickly got into a pattern of hiring and empowering psychotic pricks who were presumably "good at business". Not gonna talk about some of the things I saw because these people are wealthy and litigious.
