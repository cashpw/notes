A [[id:4398317e-6aa1-4dd4-b2a5-6334256ca2cc][Play to win]] strategy which uses answers as tools for achieving goals rather than solely as a way to gather information. The right answer is usually, but isn't always, an authentic one.

* Example(s)

- "Good." as an answer to "How's it going?" to avoid getting into the weeds on how it's actually going for you.
- "<a strength>" as an anser to "What's your greatest weakness?"
- "<their favorite restraunt>" as an answer to "Where do you want to go to eat?"
