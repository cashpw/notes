[[id:671006e6-3f41-4c37-9840-1a0a1c3f2496][Monthly newsletter]] for December, 2022.

* This month

- Migrated hosted notes from [[http://cashpw.com][cashpw.com]] to the subdomain [[http://notes.cashpw.com][notes.cashpw.com]]
- Didn't catch up on flashcard review backlog in large part because I added 100+ new cards related to solving the [[id:555129b5-299e-4605-a2cd-9f77ebcede3d][Shortest path problem]]

* Next month

- Catch up on flashcard review backlog

  I have >200 outstanding flashcards. Reviewing them all at once wouldn't just hurt now, it would hurt forever as from time to time I'd see a similarly-sized spike of due flashcards. I'll do 30[fn:1] minutes[fn:2] of review daily to bring the count down.

  This is important as I want to review new flashcards soon after creating them. Creating a flashcard on Monday and first seeing it in review on the following Monday is a poor learning experience. I'm holding off on creating new flashcards until I get through the backlog.

* Flashcards
* Footnotes

[fn:1] I selected 30 minutes since I think I'd be able to keep it up indefinitely. Some variation is okay but I don't want to get to the point that I need to review cards for 1-2 hours daily.
[fn:2] Targeting a length of time for reviews, rather than a number of cards, aligns with [[id:023f59a7-6d74-4f52-91da-448b7574defb][Timeboxing]].
