A [[id:4398317e-6aa1-4dd4-b2a5-6334256ca2cc][Play to win]] strategy which uses questions as tools for achieving goals rather than solely as a way to gather information. The right question is usually, but isn't always, an authentic one.

* Example(s)

- "Isn't that where your brother broke his leg?" as a way to push your friend to reconsider their travel plans.
- "What are you going to work on today?" as a way for a lead/manager to encourage a report to be forward-thinking in general
- "Which shoe do you want to put on first?" to a child to re-frame the usual "Please put on your shoes" into a question which lends itself to answers which benefit the parent, see [[id:8710324a-ceda-4590-86ee-ad11c3eb36b9][Xanatos gambit]]
