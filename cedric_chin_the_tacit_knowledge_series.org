* Series

1. [[id:bcba3e46-9cde-4555-accb-ec73e4f0fc4c][Cedric Chin | Why Tacit Knowledge Is More Important Than Deliberate Practice]]
   - Tacit knowledge is more useful than deliberate practice when the subject you're trying to learn isn't "well defined". "... deliberate practice is defined as possible /only/ in domains with a long history of well-established pedagogy. In other words, deliberate practice *can only exist in fields like music and math and chess*."
   - Tacit knowledge in action looks like a long list of caveats

   - YouTube, and video in general, is a wealth of tacit knowledge (e.g. [[id:eefb478b-2083-4445-884d-755005a26f2f][Pottery]]). Seek out a combination of instructional and videos where an expert is /doing/ the thing you're learning.

* Thoughts

- The [[id:731b4023-79ea-4671-9de9-2079008f14df][final entry in the series]] is also the first in [[id:5e6ac16d-668c-455b-931a-15bc1a482603][another series]]. This is a clever way to lead readers along between sequences/series. The two series are distinct enough that they can stand alone but connected enough that someone who reads one is likely to also want to read the other.
