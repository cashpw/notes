Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from imperative programming [[[id:fbcd8e5c-6ab5-4bf4-85d6-76dba84d7b5a][Imperative programming]]], based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures (a type of routine or subroutine [[[id:3823c17c-f4f2-454e-ad97-52de55d239e9][Subroutine]]]) simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages appeared circa 1957–1964, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, PL/I and BASIC. Pascal and C were published circa 1970–1972.
