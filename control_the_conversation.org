- Make sure people are talking about what you want them to talk about and in ways that benefit you.
- Treat your opponent as if they've already agreed to your position and make the next argument. See [[id:e5db0b54-03b5-417a-a4c8-93001958c410][Presupposition]].

See [[id:c718f301-2099-48b7-bad5-74fdebea137e][Ian Danskin | Control the Conversation]] and the [[id:913d6ace-03ac-4d34-ae92-5bd8a519236c][Alt-right Playbook]].

*** Back
Treat your opponent as if they've already agreed to your position and make the next argument. The goal is to have the audience perceive your opponent ([[id:a075c129-c708-4f5b-bbe7-4b5b85f3b475][Peripheral route processing]]) as conceding every time you move the argument.

- Moving the entire debate to something you and your opponent will never agree on so you can look firm in front of an adversary.
- [[id:b2575705-10cd-4523-aaa6-153360d7bd07][Moving the goalposts]] toward a subject or mode of conversation in which you can win.
