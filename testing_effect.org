The testing effect [...] suggests long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory.[4] It is different from more general practice effect, defined in the APA Dictionary of Psychology as "any change or improvement that results from practice or repetition of task items or activities."[

#+end_quote

Retrieving a piece of information from memory will increase ones ability to recall that piece of information over long periods of time. A common example would be using tests as a tool for study. The student has to attempt to recall the information from memory while taking the test and thereby improves their recall.
