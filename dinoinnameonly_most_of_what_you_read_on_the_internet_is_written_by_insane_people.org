* Notes

#+begin_quote
So Reddit consists of 97-99% of users rarely contributing to the discussion, just passively consuming the content generated by the other 1-3%. This is a pretty consistent trend in Internet communities and is known as the [[id:6db3dc17-f091-4c31-ab22-74d8ec0ebb5e][1% rule]].

But there's more, because not all the users who post do so with the same frequency. The 1% rule is of course just another way of saying that the distribution of contributions follows a [[id:29d30938-ecd0-4f44-a86b-5bd7f7734f08][Power law]], which means that the level of inequality gets more drastic as you look at smaller subsets of users.
