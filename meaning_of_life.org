I agree with "There is no meaning to life -- it just is" but don't agree with the conclusions some (gestures vaguely to the current era) have drawn. Some that I've liked include:

- We can, should, and do invent our own meanings. These self-made meanings are "true" in every definition that matters.
- "Other people" ([[id:4eaa8d9d-b4d1-4373-8723-d19d9c1dc38b][John Green]])
- [[id:b14ec1e9-5ac3-4c1a-a309-643515a10d84][The challenge is to improve yourself]]
