In philosophy, techne is a term that refers to making or doing, which in turn is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root "Teks-" meaning "to weave," also "to fabricate". As an activity, technē is concrete, variable, and context-dependent. The term resembles the concept of epistēmē [[[id:dc7e525e-967c-48e5-b1c5-d83394571cb5][Episteme]]]in the implication of knowledge of principles, in that "both words are names for knowledge in the widest sense." However, the two are distinct.
