      Metagame, Hypergame, or game about the game, is an approach
      to a game that transcends or operates outside of the
      prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to
      affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or
      environment set by the game.

      Metagaming might also refer to a game which functions to
      create or modify the rules of a sub-game. Thus, we might
      play a metagame selecting which rules will apply during the
      play of the game itself.
