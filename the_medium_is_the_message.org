[...] the medium through which we choose to communicate holds as much, if not more, value than the message itself.

For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action".

A message must "fit" its medium. That is, a message must conform to the rules of the medium it passes through. As an example: A written, printed, book cannot contain an audio. A medium controls which types of messages are possible.
