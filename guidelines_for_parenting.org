Note these are [[id:ce681f64-8116-4c83-b25a-0e108e91fddb][guidelines, not rules]], that I'm not a parent and don't know what I'm talking about, and anything below that's true is only so in a general/average sort of way and that children are unique and worthy of unique attention and care.

In no particular order:

- [[id:af1ca7da-bebf-4161-8162-057cae4a0951][Tell all the truth but tell it slant]]; tell the truth but perhaps not the full truth. The answer should be proportional to both the child's interest level and their capacity for understanding.

  To use the concept of death as an example: Be [[id:eb55ec18-edb6-4116-901a-b8c1a29a1ffc][specific and honest]] when talking about death; however, don't feel the need to mention the [[id:e549e41e-1a12-41a9-8547-540eefac6d81][Heat death of the universe]].
