Consider a public argument between two individuals. There are three participants: the two individuals and the audience around them -- the public. It can be easier to win the argument, for some definitions of win, to speak past the person you're arguing with and instead talk directly to the audience; [[id:a6d989de-a309-479e-91ab-9327b8fdf874][ignore them altogether]].

Joey Naylor (his son): ...so what happens when you're wrong?

Nick Naylor (the father lobbyist): Whoa, Joey I'm never wrong.

Joey Naylor: But you can't always be right...

Nick Naylor: Well, if it's your job to be right, then you're never wrong

Joey Naylor: But what if you are wrong?

Nick Naylor: OK, let's say that you're defending chocolate, and I'm defending vanilla. Now if I were to say to you: 'Vanilla is the best flavor ice-cream', you'd say...

Joey Naylor: No, chocolate is.

Nick Naylor: Exactly, but you can't win with this argument... so, I'll ask you: so you think chocolate is the end all and the all of ice cream, do you?

Joey Naylor: It's the best ice cream, I wouldn't order any other.

Nick Naylor: Oh! So it's all chocolate for you is it?

Joey Naylor: Yes, chocolate is all I need.

Nick Naylor: Well, I need more than chocolate, and for that matter I need more than vanilla. I believe that we need freedom. And choice when it comes to our ice cream, and that Joey Naylor, that is the definition of liberty.

Joey Naylor: But that's not what we're talking about

Nick Naylor: Ah! But that's what I'm talking about.

Joey Naylor: ...but you didn't prove that vanilla was the best...

Nick Naylor: I didn't have to. I proved that you're wrong, and if you're wrong I'm right.

Joey Naylor: But you still didn't convince me

Nick Naylor: It's thatâ€¦ I'm not after you. I'm after them (all people around)

*** Back
A technique which re-frames a discussion between yourself and another group to a discussion between yourself and the audience watching the first discussion. Implicitly redefines the goal of the original discussion from "Convince the /person I'm arguing with/ of something" to "Convince the /audience watching us/ of something", which is often a more correct goal than the former.
