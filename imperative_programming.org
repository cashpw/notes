In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm of software that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood [[[id:39f7e92f-c7df-4d0d-94cd-ef7f39437ec1][Imperative mood]]] in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates step by step, rather than on high-level descriptions of its expected results.

The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming [[[id:f234a51d-23e4-4050-bf2c-60895a99ee12][Declarative programming]]], which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying all the details of how the program should achieve the result.
