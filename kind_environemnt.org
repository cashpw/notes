The lessons learned in a kind environment are useful for accurate application (predictions, choices, inferences, etc). Also see [[id:27c588de-fa05-48cc-99c3-17c4e7689aad][Wicked environment]].

#+begin_quote
Inference involves two settings: In the first, information is acquired (learning); in the second, it is applied (predictions or choices). Kind learning environments involve close matches between the informational elements in the two settings and are a necessary condition for accurate inferences.
