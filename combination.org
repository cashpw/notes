In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a set that has distinct members, such that the order of selection does not matter (unlike permutations). For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. [...] If the set has n elements, the number of k-combinations, denoted by $C(n,k)$ or $C_{k}^{n}$, is equal to the binomial coefficient [[[id:be5ebd31-6655-4f99-9325-2c41becd4dab][Binomial coefficient]]].

To restate the example above of the orange, pear, and apple using the [[id:be5ebd31-6655-4f99-9325-2c41becd4dab][Binomial coefficient]]: $\binom{3}{2} = 3$.
