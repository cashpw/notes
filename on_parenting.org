A mega-note for all the parenting related topics I want to keep for future reference. My goal is to collect thoughts here and split topics off into [[id:6ae97f03-6ce3-437e-88cf-a9f965839477][atomic]] notes as such atomic concepts emerge.

* Parenting idea: require (pay/reward?) children to give a lesson weekly(?) on something from school, it what they've learned that week in their hobbies, sports, etc, to entourage deeper learning through teaching and a family culture of lifelong learning. Parents would do this as well. :noexport:

* Misc

- Smart kids should consider skipping high school and going directly to college; or supplementing high school with college
- [[id:75056a2e-6b7a-4764-b93c-d08aa3a99a42][Children burn out fast]]
- Know CPR and basic first aid

* On interacting with kids

- How to Talk series
  - [cite:@faberHowTalkKidsWillListenListenKidsWillTalk1999]
  - [cite:@faberHowTalkLittleKidsWillListenSurvivalGuideLifeChildren2017]
    - [cite:@weftBookReviewHowTalkLittleKidsWillListen]
  - [cite:@faberHowTalkWhenKidsWonListenWhiningFightingMeltdownsDefiance2021]
  - Use "Yes, and", "Yes, but", and "Yes, if" rather than "No" whenever possible
    - e.g. Can I read that book? Yes, but you have to put it away.
    - e.g. Will you take me to the swimming pool? Yes, if you finish your chores.
    - e.g. Can I have another snack? Yes, if you wash your dishes.

* Teaching
** To read
- [[id:a0b7f03a-9c15-4bf0-ae71-2cd4bca3e715][Read what you love until you love to read]]
- [cite:@tracingwoodgrainsBookReviewishWikipediaCofounderLarrySangerEssayTeachingReadingYear2018] and comments
- [cite:@engelmanTeachYourChildRead100EasyLessons05]
  - Supplemental material: [cite:@VideosSupplementalMaterialTeachYourChildRead100EasyLessons]
** TODO Independence, confidence, self-assurance
** TODO Use of spaced repetition
** TODO Math
- [[id:4c407900-03c1-40f0-85c6-9852da004f16][Learn math]]

* On technology

- Generally speaking, limit access to consumption-oriented activities and toward creation-oriented activities.
  - YouTube, for example, can be both.
  - This isn't a 0%/100% divide
- Hold yourself to the same standards, within reason
- Use a pi-hole or equivalent to block junk like ads and some of the web

* On learning to parent

- Find and maintain a social network of other parents
- Find one or two mentors
- Read reflections from parents
  - [cite:@jasoncrawfordReflectionsSixMonthsFatherhood]

* How much time children take up
- [[id:401eb269-861d-445a-847f-88f89c5c5971][Gunnar Zarncke | Child Development Plan - Years]]



* Alternative education styles
