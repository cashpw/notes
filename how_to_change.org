* TODO [#3] Expand
- Alter your [[id:deb3b467-3bb1-4000-9665-3a7347909ad6][Incentives]]
- Make a more-desirable pattern of behaviors easier than the less-desirable pattern (e.g. Drink less sugar-drinks by not having them in your home; don't buy them when you're shopping. One decision (don't buy them) leads to many good decisions (drink something else) because the less-desirable activity is more difficult.)
- You change when you change your underlying wants; the high-order wants that underpin who you are; [[id:6e6aa331-8dbf-4751-a896-ca5fc6c7128b][Paul Graham | What You (Want to)* Want]]
