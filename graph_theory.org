In mathematics, [[id:5bc61709-6612-4287-921f-3e2509bd2261][Graph theory]] is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of [[id:1b2526af-676d-4c0f-aa85-1ba05b8e7a93][Vertices]] (also called nodes or points) which are connected by [[id:7211246e-d3da-491e-a493-e84ba820e63f][Edges]] (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between [[id:03fd05a7-149e-49a8-be25-ca715b695add][Undirected graph]], where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and [[id:129f1b92-49f6-44af-bae3-d8a171f66f04][Directed graph]], where edges link two vertices asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in discrete mathematics.
