Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.

[...]

Some common programming paradigms are,

- imperative [[[id:fbcd8e5c-6ab5-4bf4-85d6-76dba84d7b5a][Imperative programming]]] in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
  - procedural [[[id:0cb90a5e-ec03-4a0f-bd0a-2eaeeaacc2d5][Procedural programming]]] which groups instructions into procedures,
  - object-oriented [[[id:b20d2dcc-5fed-48e6-ad9f-0ce0a2867a71][Object-oriented programming]]] which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on,
- declarative [[[id:f234a51d-23e4-4050-bf2c-60895a99ee12][Declarative programming]]] in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
  - functional [[[id:f690a8ad-4069-4e96-a707-2a57f638c493][Functional programming]]] in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
  - logic [[[id:6890c22d-7dc3-4ce9-ae3a-a9d7d288fa14][Logic programming]]] in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
  - mathematical [[[id:a4e065dd-3bcc-41e8-a26f-09e6fdf929d7][Mathematical programming]]] in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
  - reactive [[[id:f75ac439-6ecc-427c-ad1c-3d3428bc430a][Reactive programming]]] in which the desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change
