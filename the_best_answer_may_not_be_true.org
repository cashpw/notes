Don't be /too/ authentic, honest, or truthful. Sharing your actual feelings, perspective, thoughts, etc, isn't always the [[id:3e3e1507-bbc8-42eb-acea-8c73e2ff8ba9][right answer]].

Examples:

- In a position of authority (parent, manager, advisor)
  - Project authority and confidence even if you don't have it
- In relationships
  - If you're a guy: Don't show weakness/cry (based on the generally accepted cishet relationship guideline that women will, despite what they say ([[id:0a3904f5-1484-4c12-8abb-005c707401e1][Signal]]), be less attracted to you)
