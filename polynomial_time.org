In computational complexity theory [[[id:235c1171-e8bd-4b52-820c-109f34a0bc80][Computational complexity theory]]], P, also known as PTIME or DTIME($n^{\bigo{1}}$), is a fundamental complexity class. It contains all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of computation time, or polynomial time.

Cobham's thesis holds that P is the class of computational problems that are "efficiently solvable" or "tractable". This is inexact: in practice, some problems not known to be in P have practical solutions, and some that are in P do not, but this is a useful rule of thumb.
