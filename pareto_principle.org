The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few"). Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity.

[...]

Mathematically, the 80/20 rule is roughly described by a [[id:29d30938-ecd0-4f44-a86b-5bd7f7734f08][Power law distribution]] (also known as a Pareto distribution) for a particular set of parameters. Many natural phenomena distribute according to power law statistics. It is an adage of business management that "80% of sales come from 20% of clients".
