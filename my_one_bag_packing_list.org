This is my current [[id:b2910eeb-51c9-44da-99fa-b852ef70e7e6][One-bag travel]] packing list. The guiding concepts are:

1. Think in [[id:cf4068b9-bda6-49c1-812a-0314945c4425][Permutations]]

   Two tops and two bottoms makes four looks!

   Example: [[file:2023-08-20_08-33-51_9d8tx43oba3b1.jpg][Travel clothing permutations]]

2. Prefer solids to liquids

   The USA's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires that "[e]ach passenger may carry liquids, gels and aerosols in travel-size containers that are 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters. Each passenger is limited to one quart-size bag of liquids, gels and aerosols" [cite:@transportationsecurityadministrationWhat311LiquidsRule].

   Example: Bar soap rather than liquid soap

3. Multi-purpose

   Example: A [[amazon:B009VU2TQI][gaiter]] serves as a [[file:2023-08-20_08-46-26_71DjeJf2umS._AC_UX679_.jpg][scarf, face covering, headband, balaclava, sleep mask, and more!]]

* Packing list

** Clothing

I pack with the expectation that I'll do laundry every 5 days and will wear things more than once before washing them (except underwear). This allows me to pack less clothing and overall keep weight down.

* Changelog

See [[id:54aeab12-48bb-4624-a110-e0a5d50087f4][Semantic versioning]].

- 1.0.2: Extended (no replacements) based on recent [[id:ed7f1712-4b41-4199-ad3b-34b51e769952][Italy]] trip

- 1.0.1: Replace [[id:c3fef5ca-8ea0-4d8e-a8f3-f4b609ac3379][Western Rise Diversion pant]] with [[https://www.costco.com/greg-norman-men%E2%80%99s-5-pocket-travel-pant-.product.100645822.html][Greg Norman Men's 5 Pocket Travel Pants]]

  The Western Rise pants were good quality. However, they didn't look flattering on me. I switched them out for pants I found at Costco which felt similar (textile and weight) and were much cheaper (~$15 vs ~$160).

- 1.0.0: Based on extensive reading on [[http://reddit.com/r/onebag][r/onebag]] and linked sites including [cite:@malufIndefiniteBackpackTravel]

[fn:1] The adapter includes types A, C, G, and I plugs which work with most of the world's plugs.
