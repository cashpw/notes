'Mean' power is power which one gains and/or wields through socially frowned upon ways and means. Others would describe such a person as [[id:d1473888-80db-4a12-bfae-9ebdea8645a5][Machiavellian]], ruthless, amoral, or an asshole. Constrast it against [[id:01a5a051-57c8-4d55-aca3-6da89521f5b9]['Nice' power]]. Note that those seeking or employing 'mean' power may act as if they have 'nice' power.

Example traits:

- Seeks power for the sake of power
- [[id:4398317e-6aa1-4dd4-b2a5-6334256ca2cc][Plays to win]]
- "What's in it for me?" drives interactions, even 'nice' interactions
- Not genuine in thought, action, and/or emotion; employs [[id:0a3904f5-1484-4c12-8abb-005c707401e1][Signaling]]
- Plays others against each other for their own advancement

The ideal leader will employ a combination of 'nice' and 'mean' power.
