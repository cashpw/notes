From [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13zmbnnY1C6Dqls9k1oHN0ApaYB-rKn-vLb4vcfIWP9A/edit#][Lessons learned]] :

I'll write more completely about these things later. The goal for this writing session is only to get them down and out of my head. They are listed in no particular order.

- Only work on things that matter. Things that matter can be defended and argued to others; ideally with hard numbers. Be cautious about investing into projects that cannot be argued with numbers. Taking a closer look at the numbers around search keyboard usage may have led me to invest less in a technically complex keyboard solution (Kabu).
- Verify assumptions/expectations as early as possible. Get an experiment out there to confirm the things you think will happen as soon as possible. What is the minimum viable product? Build that and send it out. Confirm, with numbers, that the thing you want to build is worth building. Write your assumptions down throughout the duration of the project, especially at the beginning, and track them. How and when will you test them?
- Under promise and over deliver. Pad estimates. Be cautious when agreeing to deadlines. The unexpected always happens.
- Break projects down. Then break them down more. Trim all of the fat and get to MVP as soon as you can. From there, ensure steady and meaningful deliverables.
- Coding should be more typing than thinking. Design a solution away from the computer, then return and type it up.
- Document everything. Specifically, document what you do and the status of your projects. You'll forget more than you ever know so write it down. I have come to like this process: write down the important things you do on a daily basis, summarize those at the end of the week, summarize those every month. Then, in addition to those notes, keep a set of notes specific to each project you're working on. These project notes should include an up-to-date-at-all-times timeline of events and should include references to everything related to the project. This is more than you would ever send to someone but that's not what it is for. This document is the bible for the project. It's what you'll pull from whenever you're asked any question about the project from now until the end of time. Put time on your calendar to keep these documents up to date.
- Communicate regularly with stakeholders. Keep in mind that your audience dictates the way you present information. I've found through trial and error that a bi-weekly update is sufficient for most projects. More often than that and it's difficult to make meaningful progress enough to make the update worthwhile to write. That said, it may be useful to send something brief to your immediate team every week, or update them in a meeting.
- Communicate delays or other changes to the plan as early as possible.

Taken from my Keep notepad:

- Reach out to other teams before your invest time and effort to be sure they haven't already fixed the problem
- Find a single point of contact (tl, etc) on collaborating teams. Send them docs for easily review. Proactively communicate. It's your job to surface things and ask questions, it's not their job to think of your questions for you. Or, rather, you can't assume they will do you should act like they won't.
- Don't enter into a project without a good understanding of the benefits in a numeric sense. Kabu is, potentially, a massive 5 quarter long project which will introduce additional download times for our users and provide little in tangible benefits.
- Communicate especially when you feel too stressed to communicate. Take notes and document especially when you feel like there's no time to. Adhere to all the good engineering habits especially when you feel like you'll get them first thing on Monday when you get back.
- When feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to go for a quick walk and when you're done with the walk write down the things that need to be done. Now that it certain down, does it feel as overwhelming? Is there any way to shorten the list by making concessions or cutting features? Can you reach out to anybody on the team to help you prioritize the list?

Taken from another Keep note:

- How much mayonnaise is in the jar? Meaning, to borrow another saying, how large is the market. The same hour of effort has different results based on the project it's applied to. Understand what the payout stands to be for anything you're working on.
- Think about your project from the perspective of an l7 who couldn't give less of a shit. Can you convince them, with something concrete, to give a shit about the project?
- Rapid iteration beats coding in a tower for 6 months. Get to experiment quickly with a hack to prove that the real version is worth the effort.
- Think metrics first.
- Write up a step by step guide to evaluating projects and working on them. Include this shit so I won't forget it again.

Taken from a Keep note:

- Thoroughly reviewing existing code when coming into extend an existing project. Don't assume it's bug free. Don't assume it's written well. Don't assume the engineers who wrote it adhered to best practices or designed it in an extensible way. Don't assume there are tests of any kind (unit, integration, end-to-end).

Prioritize [[id:82d1d3b6-dd55-43bf-828e-b34508ac136c][Deep work]]

I realized when writing this that the whole lot of it is the same as what's posted all over the internet. The only difference is that these words mean more to me because I bled to learn them. It makes me wonder how much value there really is in seeking out advice online.

2019-08-20

- Only work on things that have buy in from L+1, ideally L+2 or L+3. Things that higher ups are going to be judged against are going to be the things that they are motivated to invest in. Ideally, they're success should depend on your success. This will ensure they make sure you succeed without you needing to do extra maneuvering.
- I cannot work in a silo for too long. Sometimes it is useful or necessary to work an isolation, but be extremely too long. Sometimes it is useful or necessary to work an isolation, but be extremely weary of letting it run too long.

- Cultivate a personal mindset wherein it's "cool" to try and "cool" to work hard
- Surround yourself with like-minded people (some startup-adjacent article mentioning the people you surround yourself with shape you and can either lift or drag you)
- Don't fall for the trap of working smart and not working hard because it's necessary to do both to reach as far as you can reach
  - Why do you want to reach so far? After all, it's a lot of work. [[id:3aea1e2f-dd21-4c21-a8c9-7efd610424c4][Moloch]], but also enthusiasm and curiosity and all the good reasons too.

- Workflow would be: start reviewing two_read flashcards.

* TODO [#2] Is there a phrase that describes the inappropriate individualizing of systemic problems? I thought about this in the context of citations needed episode 166. They discuss education specifically. It's propagandisement as a great equalizer. Pursuing an education is a fantastic individual strategy to increase earning potential. However, systemically, one cannot say that everything can be solved by giving people more education. That is definitely part of a solution. More education is a great thing after all. However, the episode focuses on the rhetoric around providing education as a panacea against poverty, where it is one of many things that need to be done to alleviate poverty. It is the twisting of something that's a great idea for an individual, however, is not wholly representative of a good systemic strategy.

- I find i have heater freedom when I'm following my code. I may not feel it in each moment when I may compel myself to do this or that. I feel the freedom in the moments I don't follow my code and am compelled by the world to do this or that, YouTube etc, and I look up to notice the daylight is gone – taken without my consent.
* TODO [#2] Spqr
* TODO [#2] Both sides have merit aka teach both sides
- A phrase I see brought to bear more and more, and overwhelmingly regarding culture war topics. The big one, in my mind at least, used to be creationism and the Big Bang – that schools should teach both as equally powerful and correct.
- Often wrong; only one side has merit.
- Though not a phase at the time I first heard the phrase, the underlying rationale maps cleanly onto "alternative facts". Cultural matters aren't math insofar as there isn't an objective right answer. We live in a cold universe after all. However, we can make our part of the universe warm (related, moloch and gardens). We can decide that slavery (yes I'm going for the emotionally resonant examples because I find that's what they're used with most often) is abhorrent.
- Related to "This is a matter for the states" only when a nation-wide federal/judicial-level policy isn't possible.
- Related to "The science/jury is still out"; we're right, so if the evidence doesn't bear that out then we clearly aren't fine collecting evidence and arguing – especially arguing.

* TODO [#2] This is the dream time: tech companies profits are aligned with maintaining the mental and spiritual health of their employee. Partly because the employee could go elsewhere for that kind of thing because it is now in Vogue. However, it is in Vogue because a happy employee who identifies with the company who is spiritually fulfilled produce more than employees who lack these things. And it isn't a small magnifying effect. It's a huge magnifying effect. The employees, the knowledge workers, are the asset of the company. Maintaining their mental and spiritual health is the new form of mechanization or offshoring. This kind of thing will be dropped the moment it becomes unprofitable, as moloch demands. 22:00 https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLnNvdW5kY2xvdWQuY29tL3VzZXJzL3NvdW5kY2xvdWQ6dXNlcnM6MjAwNzgzNTY2L3NvdW5kcy5yc3M/episode/dGFnOnNvdW5kY2xvdWQsMjAxMDp0cmFja3MvMTI2NjcxNzI3MQ?ep=14
