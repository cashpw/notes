Three pulls is a production / efficient [[id:eefb478b-2083-4445-884d-755005a26f2f][Pottery]] technique for wheel throwing in which one pulls the form to its full height in only three pulls:

1. Normal pull; pull as you normally would using your fingers or a sponge, etc
2. Normal pull
3. Rib pull; pull up with a wooden/etc rib on the outside

   In this way you pull and remove excess slip in the same movement.
