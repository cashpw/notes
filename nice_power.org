'Nice' power is power which one gains and wields in such a socially/culturally approved ways and means. Others would describe such a person as nice, kind, or a good person. The exact definition is a bit vague and dependent on the social norms of the culture within which the person exists. Contrast it against [[id:fd2773ca-e019-4712-a69a-6645e9d24c9b]['Mean' power]].

Example traits:

- Not interested in power for the sake of power
- Genuine in thought, action, and emotion
- Speaks truth
- Kind and supportive to others
- Politically correct
- Does 'the right thing'

The ideal leader will employ a combination of 'nice' and 'mean' power.
