In graph theory [[[id:5bc61709-6612-4287-921f-3e2509bd2261][Graph theory]]], a biconnected graph [[[id:8bff4dfc-8073-4d45-ab89-7b3f97323327][Graph]]] is a connected [[[id:b5c13a71-b6a2-4963-8d5e-4107f54a912a][Connected graph]]] and "nonseparable" graph, meaning that if any one vertex were to be removed, the graph will remain connected. Therefore a biconnected graph has no articulation vertices.

The property of being 2-connected [[[id:78c49f16-1956-4ffb-9207-f72f79025d5b][k-vertex-connected graph]]] is equivalent to biconnectivity, except that the complete graph of two vertices is usually not regarded as 2-connected.
