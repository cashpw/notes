* Notes
#+begin_quote
The performance standards are adult standards (>18 years old) for a single maximal repetition (1RM) based on competitive weightlifter and powerlifting classification systems in use from the 1950's to present.

Accumulated performance data is not predictive or regression derived. These performance standards should not to be confused with strength norms.

Standards are based on lifts with no assistive training gear (belt is acceptable) as described in each lift's official international competitive and/or as shown via link to exercise.

Training levels used in performance standards are as follows:

| Level        | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Untrained    | An individual who has not trained on the exercises before, but can perform them correctly.                                                                    |
| Novice       | An individual who has trained regularly for up to several months.                                                                                             |
| Intermediate | An individual who has trained regularly for up to a couple years.                                                                                             |
| Advanced     | An individual who has trained multiple years.                                                                                                                 |
| Elite        | An athlete competing in strength sports. Keep in mind, the standards shown in the tables do not represent the highest level of strength performance possible. |

Tables for the basic barbell exercises are based on nearly 70 years of accumulated performance data and are not predicted or regression derived. These performance standards should not to be confused with strength norms.
