Biscuit (also known as bisque) refers to any pottery that has been [[id:546a8c28-18bb-4500-bb35-a18ca162ee1f][fired]] in a kiln without a ceramic glaze. This can be a final product such as biscuit porcelain or unglazed earthenware (such as terracotta) or, most commonly, an intermediate stage in a glazed final product.
