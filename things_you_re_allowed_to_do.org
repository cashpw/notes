* Education

- Learn the things you're interested in learning. You can learn more than what you're told to learn by teachers and professors -- you can drive your own learning (related: [[id:d737d99b-5154-41f2-8b31-7c3ba860d4e0][There's no speed limit]])
- Attend university courses while in high school, or earlier, and earn credit at both levels (i.e. credit for the high school course you're in *and* the university course you'd otherwise need to take in N years)

* Meta

- Pick your own pace. Both [[id:d737d99b-5154-41f2-8b31-7c3ba860d4e0][There's no speed limit]] and there's no speed minimum

* Hire a researcher or expert consultant

I hired a researcher (Elizabeth Van Nostrand, whom you can and should hire too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!

They can:

- Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible
- Do epistemic spot checks of your work
- Map the landscape of opinions on a topic
- Write literature surveys
- Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them
- Opposition or market research
- Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance
- Compile datasets
- Find un-Googleable things
