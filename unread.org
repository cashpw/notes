* About

#+begin_quote
Relax, be kind to yourself.

[...]

You can't finish it, ever. But that doesn't mean it is a problem you need to solve. It means it's a selection to taste from.

[cite:@tene80iRelaxBeKindYourself]
#+end_quote

I [[id:ed6bc3fb-c6a6-45fe-9405-e4c74b02a5bb][collect]] these unread articles, books, essays, blog posts, discussions, threads, etc, from my various [[id:cfc5c953-4cb7-43d7-9ed6-23336d6c4587][RSS feeds]] in Inoreader.

** Criteria

I collect things that are time-independent and relevant/interesting (either now or in the future).

Examples:

- ✅ High-quality material which I'll have a hard time rediscovering through search
- ✅ Subjects I'm interested in and know I'll read through /eventually/ (e.g. parenting)
- ❌ Anything primarily time-dependent (e.g. politics and news)
- ❌ (With discretion) Things bigger than me that I cannot affect (e.g. climate change)
- ❌ Write-ups on specific technologies I don't expect to read (e.g. latest front-end hotness). I'll look these up on-demand if necessary.
