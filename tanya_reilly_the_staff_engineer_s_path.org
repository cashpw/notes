#+begin_quote
One of the core challenges of the staff+ engineering path is the unspoken expectation that part of being qualified to be on that path is figuring out how to climb it without much in the way of directions. If you were destined to be a staff+ engineer, conventional wisdom argues, you would figure out how to get there yourself. Needless to say, this is a frustrating and bias-ridden approach to career development. As more and more companies realize the need for staff+ engineers, we as an industry cannot afford to maintain a mysticism about the staff+ engineering career path that ignores the underlying skills that lead to successful technical leaders.

*** Two Paths
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (11 . 0.421402)
:END:

#+begin_quote
The staff engineer's path is a little less defined. While many companies now allow engineers to keep growing in seniority without taking on reports, this "technical track" is still muddy and poorly signposted. Engineers considering this path may have never worked with a staff engineer before, or might have seen such a narrow set of personalities in the role that it seems like unattainable wizardry. (It's not. It's all learnable.) The expectations of the job vary across companies, and, even within a company, the criteria for hiring or promoting staff engineers can be vague and not always actionable.
#+end_quote
*** The Pillars of Staff Engineering
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (13 . 0.715909)
:END:

#+begin_quote
I'll unpack the staff engineer role by looking at what I think of as its three pillars: big-picture thinking, execution of projects, and leveling up the engineers you work with.

1. Big-picture thinking

   Big-picture thinking means being able to step back and take a broader view. It means seeing beyond the immediate details and understanding the context that you're working in. It also means thinking beyond the current time, whether that means initiating yearlong projects, building software that will be easy to decommission, or predicting what your company will need in three years.

2. Execution

   At the staff level, the projects you take on will become messier and more ambiguous. They'll involve more people and need more political capital, influence, or culture change to succeed.

3. Leveling up

   Every increase in seniority comes with more responsibility for raising the standards and skills of the engineers within your orbit, whether that's your local team, colleagues in your organization, or engineers across your whole company or industry. This responsibility will include intentional influence through teaching and mentoring, as well as the accidental influence that comes from being a role model.

[...]

But technical knowledge is not enough. Success and growth at this level means doing more than you can do with technical skills alone. To become adept at big-picture thinking, execute on bigger projects, and level up everyone around you, you're going to need "humaning" skills, like:

- Communication and leadership
- Navigating complexity
- Putting your work in perspective
- Mentorship, sponsorship, and delegation
- Framing a problem so that other people care about it
- Acting like a leader whether you feel like one or not

And a lot more. Check out Camille Fournier's article "An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, Beyond Coding" [[[id:9f7ed9dc-46f1-4f12-a87e-cd03005c06dd][Camille Fournier | An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, beyond Coding]]].

#+begin_quote
First things first: staff engineering is a leadership role. [...] Whenever there's a feeling of "someone should do something here," there's a reasonable chance that the someone is you.

[...]

As your compensation increases and your time becomes more and more expensive, the work you do is expected to be more valuable and have a greater impact. Your technical judgment will need to include the reality of the business and whether any given project is worth doing at all. As you increase in seniority, you'll take on bigger projects, projects that can't succeed without collaboration, communication, and alignment; your brilliant solutions are just going to cause you frustration if you can't convince the other people on the team that yours is the right path to take. And whether you want to or not, you'll be a role model: other engineers will look to those with the big job titles to understand how to behave. [...]

Leadership comes in lots of forms that you might not immediately recognize as such [TODO: LINK]. It can come from designing "happy path" solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes. It can come from reviewing other engineers' code and designs in a way that improves their confidence and skills, or from highlighting that a design proposal doesn't meet a genuine business need. Teaching is a form of leadership. Quietly raising everyone's game is leadership. Setting technical direction is leadership. Finally, there's having the reputation as a stellar technologist that can inspire other people to buy into your plans just because they trust you.
#+end_quote
***** TODO [#1] Create and link to node

Something like: "Senior engineering leadership is indirect", "Soft leadership" versus "Hard leadership" being the distinction between telling people what to do (hard, direct) and guiding people to take the path you want them to take (soft, indirect). [[id:0d00d854-02ca-4b2f-bf1d-8321de9378f8][The slow knife penetrates the shield]]. What would you call that? Guiding somene to make a choice on their own that's also the choice you want them to make. Either by convincing them directly or by making it the easier path or by aligning [[id:deb3b467-3bb1-4000-9665-3a7347909ad6][Incentives]].
**** You're in a "Technical" Role
:PROPERTIES:
:NOTER_PAGE: (48 . 0.09091)
:END:

#+begin_quote
To be a good influence, you need to have high standards for what excellent engineering looks like and model them when you build something [[[id:c1e92962-bb77-4da1-a565-dba4d2d29076][Lead by example]]]. Your reviews of code or designs should be instructive for your colleagues and should make your codebase or architecture better. When you're making technical decisions, you need to understand the trade-offs and help other people understand them too. You need to be able to dive into the details where necessary, ask the right questions, and understand the answers. When arguing for a particular course of action, or a particular change in technical culture, you need to know what you're talking about. So you have to have a solid foundation of technical skills.

This doesn't necessarily mean you'll write a lot of code. At this level, your goal is to solve problems efficiently [TODO: LINK], and programming will often not be the best use of your time. It may make more sense for you to take on the design or leadership work that only you can do and let others handle the programming. Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else. Once the problem is tractable, it becomes a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers (sometimes with support from the staff engineer).

#+begin_quote
When you started out as an engineer, your manager probably told you what to work on and how to approach it. At senior level, maybe your manager advised you on which problems were important to solve, and left it to you to figure out what to do about it. At staff+ levels, your manager should be bringing you information and sharing context, but you should be telling them what's important just as much as the other way around. As Sabrina Leandro, principal engineer at Intercom, asks, "So you know you're supposed to be working on things that are impactful and valuable. But where do you find this magic backlog of high- impact work that you should be doing?" Her answer: "You create it!"

#+begin_quote
As a technical leader, part of a staff engineer's role is to make sure the organization has a good technical direction. Underlying the product or service your organization provides is a host of technical decisions: your architecture, your storage systems, the tools and frameworks you use, and so on. Whether these decisions are made at a team level or across multiple teams or whole organizations, part of your job is to make sure that they get made, that they get made well, and that they get written down. The job is not to come up with all (or even necessarily any!) of the aspects of the technical direction, but to ensure there is an agreed-upon, well-understood solution that solves the problems it sets out to solve.

Yonatan Zunger, distinguished engineer at Twitter, describes the four disciplines that are needed in any job in the world:

- Core technical skills

  Coding, litigation, producing content, cooking— whatever a typical practitioner of the role works on

- Product management

  Figuring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a narrative about that work

- Project management

  The practicalities of achieving the goal, removing chaos, tracking the tasks, noticing what's blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked

- People management

  Turning a group of people into a team, building their skills and careers, mentoring, and dealing with their problems

Zunger notes that the higher your level, the less your mix of these skills corresponds with your job title: "The more senior you get, the more this becomes true, the more and more there is an expectation that you can shift across each of these four kinds of jobs easily and fluidly, and function in all rooms."

"Your work needs to be important" doesn't mean you should only work on the fanciest, most glamorous technologies and VP-sponsored initiatives. The work that's most important will often be the work that nobody else sees. It might be a struggle to even articulate the need for it, because your teams don't have good mental models for it yet. It might involve gathering data that doesn't exist, or spelunking through dusty code or documents that haven't been touched in a decade. There are any number of other grungy tasks that just need to get done. Meaningful work comes in many forms. Know why the problem you're working on is strategically important—and if it's not, do something else.

#+begin_quote
By now, you should have a pretty clear picture of what the scope of your role is, how it's shaped, and what you're working on right now. But are you certain that your picture matches everyone else's? Your manager's and colleagues' expectations may differ wildly from yours on what a staff engineer is, what authority you have to make decisions, and myriad other big questions. If you're joining a company as a staff engineer, it's best to get all of this straightened out up front.

A technique I learned from my friend Cian Synnott is to write out my understanding of my job and share it with my manager. It can feel a little intimidating to answer the question "What do you do here?" What if other people think what you do is useless, or think you don't do it well? But writing it out removes the ambiguity, and you'll find out early if your mental model of the role is the same as everyone else's. Better now than at performance review time.

Your job is to make your organization successful.

Senior people do a lot of things that are not in their core job description. They can end up doing things that make no sense in anyone's job description! But if that's what the project needs to be successful, consider doing it.

- Staff engineering roles are ambiguous by definition. It's up to you to discover and decide what your role is and what it means for you.
- You're probably not a manager, but you're in a leadership role.
- You're also in a role that requires technical judgment and solid technical experience.
- Be clear about your scope: your area of responsibility and influence.
- Your time is finite. Be deliberate about choosing a primary focus that's important and that isn't wasting your skills. [see [[id:f1882164-0604-4dd9-ae59-df0d7b9d5ca2][James F. Kile, Donald J. Little, Samir Shah | Busy Person Patterns]]]
- Align with your management chain. Discuss what you think your job is, see what your manager thinks it is, understand what's valued and what's actually useful, and set expectations explicitly. Not all companies need all shapes of staff engineers.
- Your job will be a weird shape sometimes, and that's OK.

#+begin_quote
We're going to start with your place in the wider organization and company. Last chapter we talked about your scope, but to truly understand that scope, you need to see what's outside it. What's along the borders? When you zoom way out, how big is your part of the world compared to everywhere else? Think of it like one of those maps that a news station throws up behind the presenter to remind you where a particular place is, and put it in context.

You need the locator map because it's tricky to be objective about any work while you're deep inside it. Unless you can maintain perspective, the concerns and decisions of your local group will feel more important to you than they would if you looked at them on a bigger scale. So we'll try out some techniques for getting that perspective. You'll be honest with yourself about which of the projects you care about would actually show up on a big map of the company, and which ones you wouldn't see unless you zoomed all the way in.

The second map is all about navigating the terrain. If you're setting off across the landscape, you'll go further and faster if you have a robust knowledge of what's ahead. In this section, we'll look at some of the hazards on the map: the canyons and ridges along the fault lines of your organization, the weird political boundaries in places nobody would predict, and the difficult people everyone's been going out of their way to avoid. If there's quicksand ahead, or krakens to be wary of, or an impassable desert full of the sun-bleached skeletons of previous travelers, you'll want to mark those pretty clearly before you set out on your journey.

Despite the dangers and difficulties, you might find that there are navigable paths already in place. Discovering these paths will include understanding your organization's "personality" and how your leaders prefer to work, clarifying how decisions are made, and uncovering both the official and the "shadow" organization charts.

These three maps already exist in your organization; they're just obscured. When you join a new company, most of the big picture is completely unknown to you. A big part of starting a new job is building context, learning how your new organization works, and uncovering everyone's goals.

[...]

You'll be able to clear some parts of the map through everyday learning, but you'll need to deliberately set out to clear other parts. A core theme of this chapter is how important it is to know things: to have continual context and a sense of what's going on. Knowing things takes both skill and opportunity, and you might need to work at it for a while before you start seeing what you're not seeing.

[...]

Why could they see all of these things when I couldn't? Because they had learned to pay attention and they knew what they were looking for.

Paying attention means being alert to facts that affect your projects or organization. And that means continually sifting information out of the noise around you. If you can train your brain to say "That's interesting!" and remember facts that you might need later on, you'll start to add detail to your maps and build skills in synthesizing new information. What sorts of facts are useful? Anything that can help you or others have context for your work, navigate your organization, or progress toward your goals. Here are some examples:

- A company all-hands presentation about an upcoming marketing push might be a hint that huge traffic spikes you're not ready for are coming your way.
- Your director asks you to take on a project you don't have time to do, but you know which senior engineers in your organization are ready for opportunities to stretch their skills.
- A shift in corporate priorities could mean a platform you'd considered but backburnered has become an amazing investment.
- Your database just disappeared, and you remember getting an email about network maintenance.

Over time, you'll get used to how news travels in your org
and what you should pay attention to. [...] Think of
gathering context as a skill to build as part of your job.
