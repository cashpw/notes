The current era is one of relative abundance [[[id:e6c3a056-5061-4152-8b12-41f001f637a5][Slack]]] wherein mankind can resist [[id:3aea1e2f-dd21-4c21-a8c9-7efd610424c4][Moloch]] via [[id:389385dc-aab6-4631-8397-7368d80ba68d][Excess resources]]. Advances in technology have uncovered alternative routes to improving lives than the old standbys like conquering, stealing, and enslaving. This is the time of [[id:9f52c68a-3302-47bc-a4a4-3a4ff20d41be][Non-zero-sum games]] and it won't last. It can't last due to physical limitations alone: "But if income only doubled every century, in a million years that would be a factor of 103000, which seems impossible to achieve with only the 1070 atoms of our galaxy available by then" [cite:@hansonThisDreamTime].
