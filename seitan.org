Seitan is a food made from gluten, the main protein of wheat. [...] It is made by washing wheat flour dough with water [[[id:aec8ffce-c854-4800-8a3d-bf8ac3616eef][Wash the flour seitan]]] until all the starch granules have been removed, leaving the sticky insoluble gluten as an elastic mass, which is then cooked before being eaten.
