#+begin_verse
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.
#+end_verse

Not all those who wander are lost;

Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;

The crownless again shall be king.
