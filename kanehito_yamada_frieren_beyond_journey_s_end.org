[[id:0348f865-551c-40ba-a46f-89d7b66af892][Kanehito Yamada]], [cite:@yamadaFrierenJourneyEndVolume2022]

* Summary
The journey after a journey. A reflection on relationships and time, love, loss, entropy, and the melancholy of long life.
* Thoughts
- Potential spoiler: I think the ending will be a "the real solution was the journey and the friends made along the way". Flamme's way of helping Frieren will have been to force her on another difficult quest on which she'll bond with and form friendships with her adventure party. I think such an ending is appropriate because her goal is exactly that --- to bond and learn about the people around her.
