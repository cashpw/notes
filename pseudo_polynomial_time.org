#+begin_quote
In computational complexity theory, a numeric algorithm runs in pseudo-polynomial time if its running time is a polynomial in the numeric value of the input (the largest integer present in the input)â€”but not necessarily in the length of the input (the number of bits required to represent it), which is the case for polynomial time algorithms.[1]

#+begin_quote
In general, the numeric value of the input is exponential in the input length, which is why a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm does not necessarily run in polynomial time with respect to the input length.

For example, the number of integers you can represent with $n$ bits grows exponentially with $n$. You can represent 8 integers using three bits ($000 = 0$, $001 = 1$, $010$ = 2, $\dots$, $111 = 7$), 16 integers with four bits, 32 integers with five bits, etc.

*** Back
A running time which is polynomial in terms of the numeric value of the input. That is, the $n$ in $\bigo{n^k}$ is the value of the input rather than, as is more common, the length of the input.
