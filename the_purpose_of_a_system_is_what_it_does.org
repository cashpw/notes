The purpose of a [[id:c73b15fa-a2bc-48bc-8f3d-6edffc332da1][system]] is what it does (POSIWID) is a [[id:74c7b062-c946-4589-87ab-8dee95370b3b][systems thinking]] heuristic coined by [[id:115d4082-33fc-4125-a49f-52fd84f8f8b3][Stafford Beer]], who observed that there is "no point in claiming that the purpose of a system is to do what it constantly fails to do." The term is widely used by systems theorists, and is generally invoked to counter the notion that the purpose of a system can be read from the intentions of those who design, operate, or promote it. When a system's side effects or unintended consequences reveal that its behavior is poorly understood, then the POSIWID perspective can balance political understandings of system behavior with a more straightforwardly descriptive view.
