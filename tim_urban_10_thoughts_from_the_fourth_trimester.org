** 1. A newborn is not a baby
#+begin_quote
I thought it was gonna be like this:

But it's actually like this:

** 4. Babies are incredibly overdramatic

#+begin_quote
When a normal person is hungry, or tired, or needs to burp, they're a little annoyed. Babies are in Shakespearean agony. And then comes the burp and one second later they're like "sup." It's insane behavior.

For a while, the range of baby emotion runs from Shakespearean agony to neutral, never entering the positive realm. Neutral is a newborn's best-case scenario.

[[file:2023-11-08_11-02-23_10_agony.png]]

After six weeks or so, positive emotion begins to make an appearance, but then they still go apoplectic at the slightest inconvenience.

While we're here, I know it's bad but I can't help itâ€”crying babies are funny. My wife completely disagrees with me on this.

** 6. Babies shit all over your schedule

These are the sleep graphs of three different babies, but they all have one thing in common: there's no rhyme or reason in the early months, because newborns are dicks.
