[[id:ef6148e5-0f53-4535-89fa-1f67b3c557b7][Meaningful rest]] is a type of rest which leaves the individual feeling rejuvenated. It exists in contrast to default actions -- "the things that take no activation energy to start, the things [one] reflexively reaches for" [cite:@nandaPost29MeaningfulRest]. [[id:f3ce6cfc-d119-4903-94db-9a2e2d4397e0][Be conscious of your defaults]].

The term is from [[id:43e87bd7-89df-40b8-9c47-dc357c05fa63][Neel Nanda | Post 29: Meaningful Rest]].
