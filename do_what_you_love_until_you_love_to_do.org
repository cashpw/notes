I often think about the "Read what you love until you love to read" [[[id:a0b7f03a-9c15-4bf0-ae71-2cd4bca3e715][Read what you love until you love to read]]] comment from naval, and this is a good generalization. My experience has been that it is easier to educate a Do-er than to motivate the educated; you have to believe you can Do before you embark on an effort.
