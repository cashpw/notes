A mega-note for all the parenting related topics I want to keep for future reference. My goal is to collect thoughts here and split topics off into [[id:6ae97f03-6ce3-437e-88cf-a9f965839477][atomic]] notes as such atomic concepts emerge.

* Misc

- Smart kids should consider skipping high school and going directly to college; or supplementing high school with college
- [[id:75056a2e-6b7a-4764-b93c-d08aa3a99a42][Children burn out fast]]
- Know CPR and basic first aid
- Question the advice and recommendations from doctors, within reason. They may be drawing conclusions from studies which have since been overturned or succeeded by better research.
- /Gentle/ parenting is not /permissive/ parenting
  - [cite:@AttachmentParenting2023]
- **No** physical/striking/hitting punishments (e.g. spanking)
- (TODO: verify) breastfeeding > formula > nothing
  - That said, make sure the kid gets enough to eat! If you don't have enough breast milk, use formula. It's okay.


** Parenting idea: require (pay/reward?) children to give a lesson weekly(?) on something from school, it what they've learned that week in their hobbies, sports, etc, to entourage deeper learning through teaching and a family culture of lifelong learning. Parents would do this as well. :noexport:

** Home schooling

- Difficult to do right; easy to do poorly
- Consider supplemental home schooling (e.g. extra math, reading, art, etc) in conjunction with traditional school

  #+begin_quote
There are so many things to consider that I don't have time to write down all of them, but make sure if you homeschool that you are forcing yourself to be held accountable. Parents go in with the best of intentions, but then get behind and are told by other homeschool parents that it's normal and not to worry. A certain amount of flexibility is fine, but your kid getting too far behind does become an issue and is something you need to address sooner than later. Something like online school would at least hold you accountable better.

Also you need to be held accountable against abuse and your kid needs to have a number of safe adults they can confide in that won't protect you. Obviously it's easy to say you're just not going to abuse your kid, and definitely don't do that, but my parents didn't think they were abusing me. After going through abuse while being isolated, I absolutely refuse to put my kid in an unprotected situation even from myself. Your kid is also most likely to face abuse from someone close to them. If you've made it clear who they can go to for concerns about anyone, even you, it helps prevent abuse from other close adults going unreported or getting dismissed. Regular doctor appointments are important too, both for health reasons and for accountability.

Have a lot of humility. You're your child's parent, your going to be too close to always see everything that's going on. Take feedback from other people, especially those who have a background to know what they're talking about. My mom was convinced that I only struggled in math because of ADHD and carelessness, turns out I have a math learning disability that went undiagnosed my entire childhood. On the other hand, I got a lot farther in my math education than most people with math learning disabilities because of one on one teaching and higher expectations.

Do your own homework on current educational best practices. For example, teach phonetics. Not being taught to read phonetically is something that's still difficult for me. Don't just use the highly advertised Christian homeschool curriculum. Don't just search your local homeschool Facebook group and go with whatever they are recommending or giving away for free. I got taught really outdated things that way. The average Joe is not qualified to make curriculum recommendations. This isn't even a job public school teachers have. Follow expert advice. This is another reason online school can be a better option.

Get your kid involved with public school kids in non religious settings. Maybe even get them involved in public school activities. Depending on the state there is a lot in public schools available to homeschoolers. Socialization is extremely important, do not listen to anyone telling you it's not, socialization with their peers especially. I was always told it wasn't important because I would be interacting with only adults eventually anyways. Well those peers grew up to be different sorts of adults than our parents, so that didn't work out well for me at all. I also missed out on a lot of common experiences my peers had, which makes me feel like an outsider.

Give your child a choice to go to public school, and don't lie to them about, or embellish, what it's like there. Lots of homeschoolers chose to remain homeschooled because we were afraid of public school when it would have been better for us. Also counter the lies of other people about public school. Homeschooling is pushed really strongly by homeschoolers, and that can make conversations about what's really best for the kid difficult. Also different schools can be very different experiences for different kids.

I get that school shootings are concerning, but as a former homeschooler I'm going to be putting my kid into public school and keeping them there unless they really aren't doing well and want to try something else. I find homeschooling to be unnecessarily risky in America. I would also look at going through a public school program if I were to ever homeschool/online school. Parents don't know what they're doing better than the teachers that have an education in it, even if some teachers are awful. I originally went to college for education before switching majors, and there's a lot to it. My mom was a public school special education teacher before homeschooling us, and it wasn't enough. It's a lot to expect yourself to do the job of an entire school, and you're not an expert. I think homeschooling could be better, but it's not set up that way currently and I can't in good conscience recommend it as a better option, just better ways to go about it.

- Consider the political angle of those introducing policies which drive parents to home school their kids: Women will bear the brunt of the schooling labor and will, statistically, drop out of the workforce at a higher rate. This may be a desirable secondary effect; weakening women's political power and enforcing a "traditional" family structure with the mother at home.

* On sleep

- Not getting 6/8 hours of uninterrupted sleep is at 6-12 months is [[id:31baeae2-3c88-43ec-8d74-bddd68004f8e][normal]] and has no affect on later mental or psychomotor development or maternal mood

* On technology

- Generally speaking, limit access to consumption-oriented activities and toward creation-oriented activities.
  - YouTube, for example, can be both.
  - This isn't a 0%/100% divide
- Don't use screens to calm children. Doing so reduces their ability to regulate their own emotions.
