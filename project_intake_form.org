Intake form for new projects, or at least projects to which I'm new.

Include things like:

- A three-sentence description of the project
- Who are 1-3 others who (1) understand and (2) can speak to the importance of the project and (3) my importance in the project landing?
  - The opinion of these individuals should "matter". That is, ideally they're one or two promotion levels above me.
- Who are the stakeholders?
- Why is this project worth our time?
  - Why does this project matter?
  - Phrase in terms of arguing the importance of the project to a L+3 who doesn't have prior context
- What is the timeline? What are the deadlines?
  - What confidence level do we give this timeline?
  - Are there sub-timelines?
    - Assign confidence level
  - For an existing project: Have we had timelines in the past which we've already overshot?
- How do we define success for this project?
- What are the milestones?
  - Associated deadlines?
  - How do we define success for this milestone?
  - Can more than one person work on the milestones in parallel?
- What is the last 1%/10% of the project? (see below)
