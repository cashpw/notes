*The Principles Sequence is a summary of [[[id:c605b581-d3f9-4eed-a296-f7d72b580db3][Ray Dalio | Principles]]].*

Ray Dalio is best known for starting Bridgewater --- one of the largest and best performing hedge funds in the world. The book was then a handbook for Bridgewater employees, but was really a how-to guide to becoming /effective/ at life --- that is, achieving your goals, no matter how difficult things might be. In 2017, Dalio published a paper edition of the book with publisher Simon & Schuster.

Both versions of /Principles/ contain a mix of *rationalist ideas on being effective*, advice on *good decision making*, and some self-helpy bits about *self control* and *self regulation*.

The book is divided into three parts:

1. Dalio's Story — a condensed version of Dalio's personal history.
2. Life Principles — Dalio's approach to life.
3. Work Principles — Dalio's approach to building Bridgewater.

The Principles Sequence is centered around Parts One and Two, the two most valuable parts of the book. Dalio intended Part Three to be a reference — you were supposed to read Parts One and Two sequentially, and then jump around to the bits that most interested you in Part Three. For good reason: not all the ideas in Part Three are universally applicable.
