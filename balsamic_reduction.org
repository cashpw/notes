A recipe from [[id:88a66df2-ca92-404c-bfaf-67fae1c3b161][Tal Ronnen and Scot Jones and Serafina Magnussen and JoAnn Cianciulli | Crossroads]].

#+begin_quote
Made from the slow reduction of balsamic vinegar and agave nectar, this intensely flavored condiment is tart and thick. Be sure to keep an eye on the syrupy reduction as it simmers to prevent it from burning.

* Steps

1. Heat the agave in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until it thins out and is warmed (about 5 minutes)
2. Add vinegar and shallot; gently simmer, swirling the pan a few times, until the sauce has reduced and thickened to the consistency of maple syrup and coats the back of a spoon (about 50 minutes)
