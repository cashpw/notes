[[id:26795f01-3eeb-4cb0-aa43-291a091916ae][James Scott]], [cite:@scottSeeingStateHowCertainSchemesImproveHumanConditionHaveFailed2020]

* Summary
I can't say for sure whether or not this book is a [[id:065a0303-c2d3-40a0-a8fb-793f19f02526][branch]] or [[id:3784b9a9-ad2f-4537-864a-7362f21cd014][Tree book]] without having read it in its entirety. However, I've read [[id:e1b0e31a-4039-4b09-8dbd-8c3587562cca][Scott Alexander | Book Review: Seeing Like A State]] and skimmed the book itself. I think the summary does justice to the main thrusts of the book:

- [[id:a66b0533-194f-45a4-92d5-9db81589f715][Truth resists simplicity]]
- The ills of [[id:20ff7657-2f1f-459e-be7e-c59be0b042f0][Legibility]] relate to [[id:94f5d6dd-a97a-45af-be05-4e7096dea51a][High modernism]] and, more generally, the reluctance and/or inability of those in positions of power to [[id:91aae608-44c7-4dd0-94e1-512d5d5263cf][Imagine others complexly]]
- States impose [[id:20ff7657-2f1f-459e-be7e-c59be0b042f0][Legibility]] upon their people, lands, languages, etc, they require it in order to function
- [[id:20ff7657-2f1f-459e-be7e-c59be0b042f0][Legibility]] isn't all bad
  - People may resist a single system for weights and measures but states which have one are at an advantage over states who don't
  - A single language enables a cohesive culture within the state (albeit at the expense of the sub-cultures)
- [[id:20ff7657-2f1f-459e-be7e-c59be0b042f0][Legibility]] isn't all good
  - Loss of local traditions and ways of life
  - Ineffective practices and programs branded as "perfect" while based on flawed or incomplete information; see [[id:975b8bf2-d4cb-4a1d-a976-0f6d0130dbc5][Chesterton's fence]]
  - Reduction of human life to a handful of statistics (e.g. Standard Food Units, identical housing, lack of private or [[id:34fb63b5-5a47-436f-b123-a1d6ffbf4fab][Third]] places); see [[id:3aea1e2f-dd21-4c21-a8c9-7efd610424c4][Moloch]]
  - Enforces a single way of doing X which (1) doesn't allow for different preferences between individuals or groups and (2) doesn't account for how the "best way" of doing X will change over time; doesn't include room to grow, expand, or change over time.

* Thoughts
I treasure this book for introducing me to the state's (for many definitions of state) perspective in planning and system construction.

* Notes
#+begin_verse
OWEN: What is happening?
YOLLAND: I'm not sure. But I'm concerned about my part in it. It's an eviction of sorts.
OWEN: We're making a six-inch map of the country. Is there something sinister in that?
YOLLAND: Not in ...
OWEN: And we're taking place names that are riddled with confusion and...
YOLLAND: Who's confused? Are the people confused?
OWEN: And we're standardising those names as accurately and as sensitively as we can.
YOLLAND: Something is being eroded.

*** Back
A government's ability to govern, collect taxes, raise armies, etc, is greater when its people are legible. Thus, the state imposes [[id:20ff7657-2f1f-459e-be7e-c59be0b042f0][Legibility]] on its people: standards for weights and measures, names, land management, languages, etc (see [[id:94f5d6dd-a97a-45af-be05-4e7096dea51a][High modernism]]).

A book which emphasizes the perspective of a governing body on its subjects through [[id:20ff7657-2f1f-459e-be7e-c59be0b042f0][Legibility]], and [[id:94f5d6dd-a97a-45af-be05-4e7096dea51a][High modernism]]
