A form of [[id:a41fccc0-fe85-462b-b8e9-5758fd6327b3][Interoperability]] wherein the makers of two things cooperate to ensure the things are interoperable.

One of the easiest ways to do this is to adopt a standard: [...] any phone manufacturer that installs a 3.5mm headphone jack allows anyone who buys that phone to plug in anything that has a matching plug, even exotic devices like Stripe's card-readers, which convert your credit-card number to a set of tones that are played into a vendor's phone's headphone jack, to be recognized and re-encoded as numbers by Stripe's app.
