In mathematics, Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix. [...]

To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of elementary row operations:

- Swapping two rows,
- Multiplying a row by a nonzero number,
- Adding a multiple of one row to another row. (subtraction can be achieved by multiplying one row with -1 and adding the result to another row)

*** Back
An algorithm for solving a system of linear equations consisting of three operations:

1. swapping rows
2. multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar
3. adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row.

It reduces a given matrix to [[id:2b33e0aa-52e7-404b-90f0-34f6468389c0][Row echelon form]] (upper triangular), and can further reduce it to [[id:8ebdd5de-6846-42d2-b019-0404e4bba32d][Reduced row echelon form]].

- it is in row echelon form
- all leading coefficients are 1
- each column which contains a leading coefficient has only one nonzero value
