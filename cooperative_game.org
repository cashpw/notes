In [[id:e157ee7b-f36c-4ff8-bcb3-643163925c20][Game theory]], a [[id:31a42b11-aca6-41e8-a41a-5fb97006ddc2][Cooperative game]] (or coalitional game) is a game with competition between groups of players ("coalitions") due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through contract law). Those are opposed to [[id:e826003f-a13e-4cce-9b80-30f8bd802374][Non-cooperative game]] in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).
