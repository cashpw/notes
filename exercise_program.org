* Current program

My current program is a [[id:be21c5df-1559-4d50-8efb-6bd1b5db104f][Concurrent training]] consisting of [[id:07bbf4c0-e3bb-4689-9009-2cdb0404944d][Progressive overload]] resistance training ([[id:14049321-7c6d-4b23-a15f-02d2192bbeb8][5/3/1]]), running, and rowing ([[id:1ee95d06-e879-4f99-915f-3ec9a75ae412][Pete Marston | Beginner Training]]). It's informed by [[id:dec127fd-bb24-48de-8d07-52906e357792][Keith Baar | Using Molecular Biology to Maximize Concurrent Training]] to minimize cardio's negative effect on strength and hypertrophy. I'm also working through a [[id:a99628b8-d0a3-4951-8234-ba96fd820950][Pistol squat progression]].

* When away from a gym

My resistance training requires a gym with barbells, free weights, etc. I skip that training if I'm away from a gym. I continue my cardio and replace the resistance training a modified version of [[id:f2387c39-de20-48be-9733-7498f51672de][r/bodyweightfitness | Recommended Routine]].
