In mathematics, a coefficient is a multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial, a series, or an expression; it is usually a number, but may be any expression (including variables such as a, b and c). When the coefficients are themselves variables, they may also be called parameters.

For example, the polynomial $2x^{2}-x+3$ has coefficients 2, âˆ’1, and 3, and the powers of the variable $x$ in the polynomial $ax^{2}+bx+c$ have coefficient parameters $a, b, c$.
