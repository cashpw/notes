[[id:9f491719-8277-4aab-94fd-39c512730430][Muad'Dib]] learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn [[[id:85cfa8c4-9c7b-47d9-a593-8548385027f7][Pedagogy]]]. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn [[[id:c19c4cf1-9304-46b7-9441-8fed0ed17a57][Growth mindset]]]. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn [[[id:3a203296-7538-4986-a360-0db64356c9f5][Fixed mindset]]], and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
