Senior software engineers manage the scope of their projects:

- Avoid [[id:9a90c09a-ca87-49ec-8867-d56de23fd33f][Scope creep]] and [[id:15b20b89-9fde-416c-a7af-3d2cafae5ebb][Feature creep]]
- Trim the scope down with an eye to the [[id:f49b7372-f38a-470e-8e1f-d26a64ff4992][Pareto principle]]

* TODO Reference some blog post I remember which emphasized a senior engineer can identify the bits of a project that are going to take 80% effort to deliver 20% results and remove those bits :noexport:

* Flashcards :noexport:
