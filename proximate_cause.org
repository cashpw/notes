- They're both "true"

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Concordia][Costa Concordia]] in terms of [[id:9245a0f6-660f-4820-9e03-793dc5978686][Ultimate cause]] and [[id:b17c08ec-80de-45e5-8a8e-529b0f31142c][Proximate cause]]

*** Back
In order from [[id:b17c08ec-80de-45e5-8a8e-529b0f31142c][Proximate cause]] to [[id:9245a0f6-660f-4820-9e03-793dc5978686][Ultimate cause]] (and beyond to absurdity). The ship sank because:

- It hit a rock ([[id:b17c08ec-80de-45e5-8a8e-529b0f31142c][Proximate cause]])
- The helmsman failed to implement the captain's order (language barrier, turned the wrong way)
- The captain wasn't paying close enough attention; distracted
- The captain sailed the boat close to an island for a salute
- The captain was re-hired and put in charge of a cruise liner /after/ crashing a previous cruise liner
- People settled in the Mediterranean
