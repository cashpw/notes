The Big Five personality traits is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits, developed from the 1980s onward in psychological trait theory.

Starting in the 1990s, the theory identified five factors by labels, for the US English population, typically referred to as:

1. openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
1. conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
1. extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
1. agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
1. neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)
