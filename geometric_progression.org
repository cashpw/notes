In mathematics, a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of non-zero numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the /common ratio/. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.

Examples of a geometric sequence are powers /r/^{/k/} of a fixed non-zero number /r/, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two][2^{/k/}]] and 3^{/k/}. The general form of a geometric sequence is

$a,ar,ar^{2},ar^{3},ar^{4},\ldots$

where /r/ ≠ 0 is the common ratio and /a/ ≠ 0 is a scale factor, equal to the sequence's start value.

The distinction between a progression and a series is that a progression is a sequence, whereas a series is a sum.
