Predictable behavior is a boon in the types of relationships I want to cultivate. I aspire to act predictably because:

- It eases the mental burden on those around me

  Friends, children, family, co-workers, peers, etc, don't have to wonder how I'll react or how I'll behave. They can trust in a consistent version of who I am.

- It's corelated with reliability

- It implies, at least for me, good communication

  I've communicated what I think, feel, and what my intentions are and predictability is the following-up on those promises.

* Predictable parenting

Guidelines:

- Only say things you're comfortable standing behind; don't bluff
- Don't make unnecessary commitments
- Use fewer, more general, rules
- Follow through on what you said
