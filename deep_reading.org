Deep-dive reading is my term for reading more than one source either on a particular topic or by a particular author with the goal of gaining deeper understanding. This is in contrast to [[id:24fd625a-f971-453f-bdda-7d94394eebaa][Shallow-dive reading]].

* Example(s)

- Reading many/all of the published works of a single author
- Reading more that one source on a subject
- Reading more than one translation of a source

* Flashcards
