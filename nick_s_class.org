In computational complexity theory [[[id:235c1171-e8bd-4b52-820c-109f34a0bc80][Computational complexity theory]]], the class NC (for "Nick's Class") is the set of decision problems decidable in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors. In other words, a problem with input size $n$ is in NC if there exist constants $c$ and $k$ such that it can be solved in time $\bigo{\log^c n}$ using $\bigo{n^k}$ parallel processors. Stephen Cook coined the name "Nick's class" after Nick Pippenger, who had done extensive research on circuits with polylogarithmic depth and polynomial size.

Just as the class P [[[id:9abc3978-c42a-42ad-a309-9f50c3698c0f][P (Complexity)]]] can be thought of as the tractable problems (Cobham's thesis), so NC can be thought of as the problems that can be efficiently solved on a parallel computer.
