I've titled this "Guidelines" as opposed to "Rules" because:

1. No two children are the same and they each benefit from an individualized approach. That said, [[id:f49b7372-f38a-470e-8e1f-d26a64ff4992][most of this is applicable to most children]].
2. Rules have, to me at least, an air of finality and I mean for these guidelines to expand and change over time

The guidelines:

- [[id:af1ca7da-bebf-4161-8162-057cae4a0951][Tell all the truth but tell it slant]]; tell the truth but perhaps not the full truth. The answer should be proportional to both the child's interest level and their capacity for understanding.

  To use the concept of death as an example: Be [[id:eb55ec18-edb6-4116-901a-b8c1a29a1ffc][specific and honest]] when talking about death; however, don't feel the need to mention the [[id:e549e41e-1a12-41a9-8547-540eefac6d81][Heat death of the universe]].
