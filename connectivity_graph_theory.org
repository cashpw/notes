In an undirected graph [[[id:03fd05a7-149e-49a8-be25-ca715b695add][Undirected graph]]] $G$, two vertices $u$ and $v$ are called connected if $G$ contains a path [[[id:0a8c2a35-590e-4f8b-9d98-40a44e15dfb7][Path (graph theory)]]] from $u$ to $v$. Otherwise, they are called disconnected. If the two vertices are additionally connected by a path of length 1, i.e. by a single edge, the vertices are called adjacent.

#+begin_quote
A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. This means that there is a path between every pair of vertices.

An undirected graph that is not connected is called disconnected.

A directed graph [[[id:129f1b92-49f6-44af-bae3-d8a171f66f04][Directed graph]]] is called weakly connected if replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected (undirected) graph [[[id:b5c13a71-b6a2-4963-8d5e-4107f54a912a][Connected graph]]].

[A [[id:129f1b92-49f6-44af-bae3-d8a171f66f04][Directed graph]]] is unilaterally connected or unilateral (also called semiconnected) if it contains a directed path from u to v or a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u, v.
