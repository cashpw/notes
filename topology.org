In mathematics, topology is concerned with the properties of a geometric [[[id:e67fa9ff-5bb3-47cd-8559-0c3a25300f0d][Geometry]]] object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself.
